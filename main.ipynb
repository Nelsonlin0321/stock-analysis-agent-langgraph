Shares of energy drink company Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) fell 5.2% in the pre-market session after the company reported disappointing first quarter 2025 results: while gross margin beat expectations, revenue missed significantly. Revenue dropped over 2%, weighed down by fewer orders from distributors, currency hits overseas, and a sharp fall in alcohol-related sales. Management did point to stronger sales in April and solid retail numbers for energy drinks overall, which could mean things are turning around. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The shares closed the day at $60.99, up 1.4% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Monster? Access our full analysis report here, it\\\\u2019s free . What The Market Is Telling Us Monster\\\\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 4 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\\\\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock dropped 11.9% on the news that the company reported weak second-quarter 2024 results. Its revenue unfortunately missed analysts\\' expectations, and its EPS missed Wall Street\\'s estimates. Citing some of the drivers of the weak performance, management added, \\\\\"The energy drink category in the United States and in certain other countries experienced lower growth rates in the second quarter. Retailers have reported a reduction in convenience store foot traffic, and we have seen a shift at retail towards more mass and dollar channels. Other beverage and consumer packaged product companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment and weaker demand in the quarter.\\\\\" Overall, this was a weaker quarter for Monster. Monster is up 16.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $61 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Monster\\\\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,837. Unless you\\\\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Net sales totaled $1.85 billion, down 2.3% from $1.9 billion a year earlier. However, gross profit margin expanded to 56.5%, up from 54.1%, signaling improved cost efficiency.\\\\n$MNST | Monster Beverage Q1 25 Earnings:\\\\n\\\\u2022 Monster Energy Drinks Net Sales: $1.72B (est. $1.8B) \\\\u2022 Net Sales: $1.85B (est. $1.98B) \\\\u2022 Gross Margin: 56.5% (est. 54.7%) \\\\u2022 Net Sales Outside US: $733.2M, -1.5% Y/Y \\\\u2022 Operating Expense: $478.2M (est. $497.9M) \\\\u2022 EPS: $0.45 vs.\\\\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nLiDfbhsPh\\\\n\\\\u2014 LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) May 8, 2025\\\\nEarnings per share advanced 7.4% to $0.45, topping last year\\\\u2019s $0.42. Net income held steady at $443 million, just slightly higher than the prior year\\\\u2019s $442 million. Operating income grew by 5.1% to $569.7 million, supported by reduced expenses and better margin control.\\\\nInternational Markets Offset Weak US Trends\\\\nMonster\\\\u2019s international performance helped cushion the domestic softness. Net sales outside the US climbed 6.2% on a currency-neutral basis, reaching $790.5 million. Key markets like China surged 40.1% while Oceania rose 21.6%. New product launches and expanded flavors in global regions helped drive this growth.\\\\nIn contrast, US sales saw headwinds. The company\\\\u2019s market share in the convenience and gas channel slipped slightly to 29%, down from 29.2%. Sales for certain brands like Rain and Full Throttle dropped, with Rain sales falling 9.9% in the latest 13-week period. The Alcohol Brands segment also struggled, seeing a steep 38.1% revenue decline.\\\\nCurrency and Demand Challenges Remain\\\\nForeign exchange fluctuations negatively impacted Monster\\\\u2019s top line by $57.3 million during the quarter. Management flagged distributor ordering patterns and broader economic uncertainty as additional factors that weighed on results.\\\\nStill, the energy drink category remains on a growth trajectory globally. Monster continues to gain market share in regions such as Belgium, Denmark, and Germany, though the US softness remains a concern. The company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, particularly in China and India, where the Predator brand is set for further expansion.\\\\nOutlook and Stock Performance\\\\nMNST stock has outperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, returning 16.96% year-to-date compared to the index\\\\u2019s 3.74% decline. Over a 1-year period, Monster shares are up 11.37%. The stock remains well-positioned, although ongoing challenges in the US and foreign exchange pressures could weigh on near-term growth.\\\\nMonster\\\\u2019s next earnings date is scheduled between August 5 and August 11, 2025. Investors will be watching whether international strength can continue to offset US market softness.\\\\nYasmin Werner\\\\nX (Twitter)\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nYasmin is a crypto content analyst and writer with over 2 years of experience.

Shares of energy drink company Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) fell 5.2% in the pre-market session after the company reported disappointing first quarter 2025 results: while gross margin beat expectations, revenue missed significantly. Revenue dropped over 2%, weighed down by fewer orders from distributors, currency hits overseas, and a sharp fall in alcohol-related sales. Management did point to stronger sales in April and solid retail numbers for energy drinks overall, which could mean things are turning around. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The shares closed the day at $60.99, up 1.4% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Monster? Access our full analysis report here, it\\\\u2019s free . What The Market Is Telling Us Monster\\\\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 4 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\\\\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock dropped 11.9% on the news that the company reported weak second-quarter 2024 results. Its revenue unfortunately missed analysts\\' expectations, and its EPS missed Wall Street\\'s estimates. Citing some of the drivers of the weak performance, management added, \\\\\"The energy drink category in the United States and in certain other countries experienced lower growth rates in the second quarter. Retailers have reported a reduction in convenience store foot traffic, and we have seen a shift at retail towards more mass and dollar channels. Other beverage and consumer packaged product companies have also seen a tighter consumer spending environment and weaker demand in the quarter.\\\\\" Overall, this was a weaker quarter for Monster. Monster is up 16.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $61 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Monster\\\\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,837. Unless you\\\\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Net sales totaled $1.85 billion, down 2.3% from $1.9 billion a year earlier. However, gross profit margin expanded to 56.5%, up from 54.1%, signaling improved cost efficiency.\\\\n$MNST | Monster Beverage Q1 25 Earnings:\\\\n\\\\u2022 Monster Energy Drinks Net Sales: $1.72B (est. $1.8B) \\\\u2022 Net Sales: $1.85B (est. $1.98B) \\\\u2022 Gross Margin: 56.5% (est. 54.7%) \\\\u2022 Net Sales Outside US: $733.2M, -1.5% Y/Y \\\\u2022 Operating Expense: $478.2M (est. $497.9M) \\\\u2022 EPS: $0.45 vs.\\\\u2026 pic.twitter.com/nLiDfbhsPh\\\\n\\\\u2014 LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) May 8, 2025\\\\nEarnings per share advanced 7.4% to $0.45, topping last year\\\\u2019s $0.42. Net income held steady at $443 million, just slightly higher than the prior year\\\\u2019s $442 million. Operating income grew by 5.1% to $569.7 million, supported by reduced expenses and better margin control.\\\\nInternational Markets Offset Weak US Trends\\\\nMonster\\\\u2019s international performance helped cushion the domestic softness. Net sales outside the US climbed 6.2% on a currency-neutral basis, reaching $790.5 million. Key markets like China surged 40.1% while Oceania rose 21.6%. New product launches and expanded flavors in global regions helped drive this growth.\\\\nIn contrast, US sales saw headwinds. The company\\\\u2019s market share in the convenience and gas channel slipped slightly to 29%, down from 29.2%. Sales for certain brands like Rain and Full Throttle dropped, with Rain sales falling 9.9% in the latest 13-week period. The Alcohol Brands segment also struggled, seeing a steep 38.1% revenue decline.\\\\nCurrency and Demand Challenges Remain\\\\nForeign exchange fluctuations negatively impacted Monster\\\\u2019s top line by $57.3 million during the quarter. Management flagged distributor ordering patterns and broader economic uncertainty as additional factors that weighed on results.\\\\nStill, the energy drink category remains on a growth trajectory globally. Monster continues to gain market share in regions such as Belgium, Denmark, and Germany, though the US softness remains a concern. The company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, particularly in China and India, where the Predator brand is set for further expansion.\\\\nOutlook and Stock Performance\\\\nMNST stock has outperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, returning 16.96% year-to-date compared to the index\\\\u2019s 3.74% decline. Over a 1-year period, Monster shares are up 11.37%. The stock remains well-positioned, although ongoing challenges in the US and foreign exchange pressures could weigh on near-term growth.\\\\nMonster\\\\u2019s next earnings date is scheduled between August 5 and August 11, 2025. Investors will be watching whether international strength can continue to offset US market softness.\\\\nYasmin Werner\\\\nX (Twitter)\\\\nLinkedIn\\\\nYasmin is a crypto content analyst and writer with over 2 years of experience.
